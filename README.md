# Spambot-with-list-Python
This is a Python-Spambot with commands from Linux-Terminal which I choosed randomly. I wrote it, because my IT-Teacher wants from us, to do 20 commands a week on his server on the terminal and im too lazy and forgettable to do it by myself.

First you have to install the pyautogui: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ83Xz2K-ps

You have to start the bot and then you have 3 seconds to change in the "message box", now you have to wait until it's finished.
